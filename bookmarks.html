                In 2007, Charan made his film debut as the leading actor in Chirutha, an action film directed by Puri Jagannadh which completed 50 days in 178 direct cinemas and 15 other shifted cinemas.[19] He played the role of Charan, an ex-convict seeking to kill his father's murderer. Rediff.com praised his performance, stating: "Ram Charan is quite promising. Dance and action appear to be forte. He is rather graceful in the dance numbers. He also stays clear of any oblique reference to his star father by way of dialogue or adopting any particular mannerism or style."[20] His performance in the film earned him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut – South and the Nandi Special Jury Award.[21][22]
                
                After the release of his second film, the fantasy film Magadheera (2009), Charan established himself as one of the leading contemporary actors in Tollywood. The film, in which he played dual roles, was directed by S. S. Rajamouli, and Charan's performance was critically acclaimed. The Times of India stated that "Ram Charan returns as a valiant soldier and breathes life into the larger-than-life role with ease. He showcases his horse-riding and dancing skills to perfection."[23] IndiaGlitz commented: "Charan has come up with a mature performance and he has carried the film very well. Both his characters were done justice, and he reminded of his father at many places."[24] Magadheera grossed over ₹150 crores worldwide and held the record of being the highest-grossing Telugu film until 2013 before it was surpassed by Attarintiki Daredi.[25] The film received six Filmfare Awards including two awards – Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and the Nandi Special Jury Award for Charan.[26]

                Charan starred in Bommarillu Bhaskar's urban romance Orange in 2010 as Ram, a NRI living in Australia.[27] Although the film didn't perform well at the box office, critics praised the storyline and performance by Charan.[28] Jeevi of Idlebrain felt that Charan didn't try to stick to stardom and is not willing to repeat the mistakes performed by other stars.[29] Over the years, it became a cult film and received appreciation from the audience.[30] In her article for Film Companion, Alekhya Devarakonda compared his character to Howard Roark of 1943 novel The Fountainhead.[31] Following a year-long absence from the screen, he next appeared in Racha (2012), directed by Sampath Nandi.

The film completed a 100-day run in 38 centres across Andhra Pradesh on 13 July 2012.[32] Racha's final share for its distributors was ₹45 crore (equivalent to ₹85 crore or US$10 million in 2023).[33] His performance in the film earned him acting nominations at the Filmfare and SIIMA award ceremonies.[34][35] Sify stated, "Both, actor Ram Charan and his director Sampath Nandi play a safe game by following the same pattern of earlier mass-masala movies."[36] Radhika Rajamani of Rediff criticised the plot of the film, but praised Charan's performance in action sequences and dance moves.[37] IndiaGlitz wrote: "He shows flashes of Chiru-ness more than he ever did in the past; be it his baritone or demeanor, he is a megastar in effect. Helped by a strong script, he could have been much better."[38] The film was released on 5 April 2012 and was declared a commercial success.[39]
                
                
                Charan with Priyanka Chopra during promotions of their film Zanjeer in 2013
                Charan had two films released in 2013. His first release was Naayak, directed by V. V. Vinayak, in which he played a dual role, once again after Magadheera. Writing to The Times of India, Karthik Pasupulate wrote that "Ram Charan did a great job, though there was no variation shown between the two characters."[40] It opened to mixed critical reviews and became a commercial success.[41] The film brought him two nominations – the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and the SIIMA Award for Best Actor (Telugu), once again, with a Best Actor award at TSR – TV9 National Film Awards.[42] The same year he made his Hindi cinema debut alongside Priyanka Chopra in the Telugu-Hindi bilingual film Zanjeer, a remake of the 1973 film of the same name.[43][44] He played the role of ACP Vijay Khanna who swears vengeance on his parents' killer. Charan made his debut as a playback singer with the song "Mumbai Ke Hero", composed by Chirrantan Bhatt, from the album Thoofan, the Telugu version of Zanjeer.[45] Rediff called it as "an unforgivably bad remake."[46] Film critic Rajeev Masand criticised his performance writing that he "comes off as stiff as a wax statue in his Bollywood debut, with barely any emotion, forget brooding anger."[47] Amid huge expectations, the film became a box-office bomb."</p>

                        In 2006, he reunited with his brother for the cult gangster film, Pudhupettai.[30] It portrayed a young man's journey from a street urchin to gangster, receiving mixed reviews, initially, though Dhanush's performance received major praise. However, over the years, the film has undergone a critical re-evaluation and is now considered to be one of the greatest Tamil films ever made, whilst also garnering a huge cult following.[31] Dhanush subsequently received his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil, for his performance in the film. That same year, he also reunited with Boopathy Pandian after Devathaiyai Kanden, for the romantic comedy, Thiruvilaiyaadal Aarambam, opposite Shriya Saran and Prakash Raj.[32][33] It was a major commercial success, a first for Dhanush, after several average and below-average grossers.
                        
                        Dhanush's first release of 2007, Parattai Engira Azhagu Sundaram did not do well at the box office.[34] The film was a remake of the successful Kannada language film Jogi (2005). However, his second film Polladhavan was released during Diwali 2007. Polladhavan was based on the 1948–Italian neorealist film Bicycle Thieves and Dhanush's performance was appreciated.[35]
                        
                        The following year, the remake of a Telugu film directed by his brother formed the plot line for Dhanush's next film directed by debutant Mithran Jawahar, later titled Yaaradi Nee Mohini.[36] The romantic comedy proved to be a major critical and commercial success, thus earning Dhanush his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil. He later appeared in a cameo appearance, for his father-in-law Rajinikanth's venture Kuselan. His subsequent venture was Suraj's Padikathavan, which was released in January 2009.[37] His performance was praised and well received.[38] His next two films Kutty and Uthama Puthiran, were both collaborations with director Mithran Jawahar.[39]
                        
                        The song "Un Mele Aasaidhaan" from the action-adventure film Aayirathil Oruvan, which featured him alongside his then wife Aishwarya Rajinikanth, won him his first Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer – Tamil.
                        
                        2011–2014: Critical success
                        
                        Dhanush with Amitabh Bachchan at the BIG Star Entertainment Awards in 2012
                        
                        Dhanush with actor Vijay in 2014
                        Dhanush's first release in 2011, which he had shot for over three years, was Aadukalam, marking his second collaboration with Vetrimaran. Dhanush played the role of a local cockfighter and described the venture as his "dream project" during production.[40] The film gained widespread critical acclaim and won six awards at the 58th National Film Awards, with Dhanush receiving the National Film Award for Best Actor,[41] becoming the youngest actor to win the award.[42] He also won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil for his performance in the film. Dhanush appeared in an extended guest appearance in Subramania Siva's Seedan. His next two ventures were the action films, Mappillai, a remake of his father-in-law's same-titled 1989 film and Venghai, by Hari, which received mixed reviews but was a commercial success."</p

                Career
                2002–2014: Early work and career progression
                Prabhas made his debut with the action drama Eeswar (2002). In 2003, he was the lead in Raghavendra. In 2004, he appeared in Varsham and Adavi Raamudu.

In 2009, his two films were Billa and Ek Niranjan. Indiaglitz called Billa "stylish and visually rich".[26] Ek Niranjan earned him his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.
                
                In 2010, he appeared in the romantic comedy Darling which received positive reviews upon release. The Times of India gave a 2.5 star rating explaining "Director Karunakaran extracts good performances from his actors, but can't come up with a refreshing plot. It looks like the director hasn't really come out of his Tholi Prema hangover as he dishes out yet another one-sided love saga but fails to come up with a valid and logical reason to make a GenZ lad to hold back his feelings for his lover until the last moment. However, he compensates it all, by adding loads of fun moments in the film and the screenplay does have its share of some touching moments."[27]
                
                In 2011, he appeared in another romantic comedy Mr. Perfect. The review site GreatAndhra rated the film with three stars and noted "The film comes across as a clean, family entertainer and the intention of the makers must be appreciated.[28] His performance in the film earned him his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.
                
                In 2012, Prabhas starred in Rebel, an action film directed by Raghava Lawrence. Sashidhar from The Times of India stated, "The film belongs to hard-core Prabhas fans as the movie is stylish and visually rich but not much in content".[29] Purnima Ranawat from NDTV said, "Rebel serves up fare for the mass audience. The film will be definitely liked by Prabhas' fans. Watch it for the dancing talent of Tamannaah Bhatia and action skills of Prabhas."[30] Radhika Rajamani from Rediff.com gave the movie 1.5 stars out of five and said, "Working with hardly any storyline, director Raghava Lawrence had made a film that is arduous to watch... Rebel is a movie for the masses and certainly not for the discerning audience."[31] He also rendered voice for a short cameo for the film Denikaina Ready (2012).[32]
                
                In 2013, Prabhas starred in Mirchi. Jeevi of Idlebrain.com gave a rating of 3.25 out of 5, commenting that "First half of Mirchi is decent. Flashback episodes which occupies the lion's share of the second half is good. Climax could have been better. The plus points of the film are Prabhas, music and all-round orientation. On a whole, Mirchi has all the ingredients of a commercial potboiler".[33] Mahesh S Koneru gave his verdict that "At the box office, the film will turn in a good commercial performance", giving the film a score of 3.25/5.[34] Way2movies also gave a rating of 3.25/5, giving the verdict that "Prabhas rocks the show in this decent yet formulaic commercial entertainer".[35] SuperGoodMovies gave the film 3 stars in a scale of 5, reviewing that "Go and Watch Mirchi, It entertains both class and mass. It is a worth watch."[36] His performance in the film earned him his fifth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. He then made his Hindi cinema debut in 2014 in the special dance number "Punjabi Mast" from the film Action Jackson."</p
